# Ada ITW Workshop

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

This fun game I made at a Workshop I remotely attended to on April 2020 at Ada ITW for introducing us into Javascript programming language.

## Technologies used

HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Here's my job!

Have fun facing Anchoa. She pretty much rocks.
